Arduino random number generator using sha1 for hammering in randomness wether we need it or
want it.


The calibration routing is from the orignal code and helps deal with things that happen
to transistors as they aged. Find a micro-E for an actual explanation that makes sense.

NOTE:
If you change the transistor to something with a different reverse bias threshold, the entire
thing can either get better or fall apart completely
